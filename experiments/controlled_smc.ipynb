    "### Static models\n",
    "The motivation for static models usually involves sampling from a target distribution (i.e. $\\eta(dx) = Z^{-1} \\gamma(dx) \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\text{X})$ ) and/or estimating the normalization constant $Z = \\gamma(\\text{X})$; to make this a non-homogeneous Markov process, define a sequence of probability measures ($ \\eta_{t | t \\in [0:T]}$) that bridges a simple distribution $\\eta_0 = \\mu$ to a target $\\eta_T = \\eta$ such that $\\eta \\ll \\mu$. <br>\n",
    "A common way to make a sequence of bridges is to define $\\gamma_t(dx) = \\mu(dx) \\left( \\frac{d \\gamma}{d \\mu} (x) \\right)^{\\lambda_t}$ where $\\eta_t(dx) \\equiv \\gamma_t(dx)/Z_t$, $\\lambda_{t} \\in [0,1]$, $\\lambda_0=0, \\lambda_T = 1$ for $t \\in [0:T]$. To define $\\mathbb{Q}$, we define a bunch of 'forward' kernels $M_t \\in \\mathcal{M}(\\text{X})$ where $\\eta_{t-1}M_t$ approximates $\\eta_t$. It is expected that the distribution $\\hat{\\eta} = \\eta_0 M_1 ... M_T$ will be close to $\\eta_T = \\eta$, but importance sampling cannot be employed to correct this discrepancy since $\\hat{\\eta}$ is usually intractable.<br>\n",
    "Instead, we can perform importance sampling on the path space $(\\text{X}^{T+1}, \\mathcal{X}^{T+1})$ be creating a distribution of the form\n",

    "where $L_t \\in \\mathcal{M}(\\text{X})$ is a sequence of auxiliary 'backward' kernels. If $L_{t-1} \\otimes \\gamma_t \\ll \\gamma_{t-1} \\otimes M_t$ that satisfy the Radon-Nikodym criteria, then the Feynman-Kac path measure can be recovered by defining $G_0(x_0) = 1$ and $G_t(x_{t-1}, x_t) = \\frac{d\\left( L_{t-1} \\otimes \\gamma_t \\right)}{d \\left( \\gamma_{t-1} \\otimes M_t \\right)}(x_{t-1}, x_t)$.
